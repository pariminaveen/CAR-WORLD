<p>In 1989, Mike Dewitt started The Car Company in Warsaw, IN as a small body shop and has since then grown the company from 10 sales a month from 1 location to over 350 sales a month at 3 locations. We recently became a new car franchise with a full line of Suzukiâ€™s featuring the latest models of their SUVs and cars</p>.

We feel that one of the reasons that we have been successful is because of the way we treat all of our customers, the way we pay our sales staff, and being able to extend credit from our finance companies to nearly all of our customers. By not paying our sales staff on commission, they do not care how much money is spent. What they concentrate on is making the customer happy and meeting there wants and needs so they will come back as well as send in referrals and help us build our customer base.
